Welcome to my Portfolio Repository — a collection of projects, experiments, and learning exercises showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and general IT practices.

I am a dual student in IT, working as a System and Network Administrator, and this portfolio reflects both my academic progress and practical experience.

🚧 This repository is a work in progress
Content is updated regularly as I improve existing projects and add new ones.
